This is my first project using Machine Learning.

## How to use this project

You can start training the _AI model_ by using multiple cars.

Here are the steps:-

- Start running the application using 1000 cars.
- Let it run until all the cars have finished its course.
- Now click the "Save" button to save the AI model to your local storage.
- Keep repeating the process until you have developed a new car model that works sufficiently.
